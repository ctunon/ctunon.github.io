            <header class="title"><h1>Alternate Picking</h1></header>
            <p>
                Alternate picking is a guitar playing technique that employs alternating downward and upward 
                strokes in a continuous fashion. If the technique is performed at high speed on a single string 
                or course voicing the same note, it may be referred to as "tremolo picking" or "double picking".

            <h3 class="title">The Spider</h3>
            <p>
                Spider exercises are named for the appearance of the fingers crawling across the fretboard. 
                Most of these exercises sound a bit dissonant and spooky but are great tools for building technique. 
                Many beginners have trouble keeping their left-hand fingers in a ready position. 
                These exercises help get your fingers accustomed to the feel of a good hand position.

        <section id="Legato" class="main-section">
            <header class="title"><h1>Legato</h1></header>
            <p>
                Legato is a musical term and playing technique used in guitar playing, 
                as well as in various other musical instruments, to create a smooth, flowing, 
                and connected sound between notes. It is often contrasted with staccato, which involves short, 
                disconnected, and separated notes. In guitar playing, legato is achieved by minimizing the gaps 
                or silence between successive notes, making the melody or passage sound seamless and graceful.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><i>The key elements of legato guitar playing include:</i></p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Hammer-ons: This technique involves playing a note and then using a finger to tap down on a higher fret 
                    without picking the string again. This creates a smooth transition from one note to the next, as the 
                    notes blend together.</li>
                <li>Pull-offs: Pull-offs are the opposite of hammer-ons. In a pull-off, you play a higher note and then 
                    use a finger to "pull" off the string to a lower fret or open string while letting the string vibrate. 
                    This technique also helps to connect notes without re-picking.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="title">The Go and Return</h3>
            <p>
                This exercise consists in doing a patron of the major scale while doing hammer-ons and pull-offs across the fretboard,
                another way of doing it is to repeat the movement 2 times per string.

        <section id="Tapping" class="main-section">
            <header class="title"><h1>Tapping</h1></header>
            <p>
                Tapping is a playing technique that can be used on any stringed instrument, but which is most commonly used on guitar. The technique involves a string being fretted and set into vibration as part of a single motion. This is in contrast to standard techniques that involve fretting with one hand and picking with the other. Tapping is the primary technique intended for instruments such as the Chapman Stick.

            <h3 class="title">3-Note Tapping Patterns</h3>
            <p>
                3-note tapping patterns are a quick and easy way to get started learning how to tap. You only need to alternate back and forth between three notes, so these exercises are quick to learn and easy to master.

            <header class="title"><h1>String Skipping</h1></header>
            <p>
                String skipping is a guitar playing technique where you intentionally skip over one or more adjacent strings while playing a sequence of notes or a scale. Instead of playing consecutive notes on adjacent strings, you leapfrog over one or more strings to create a specific musical pattern or effect.
            </p>
            <h3 class="title">Flat Picking</h3>
            <p>
                Proper flatpicking technique (using a plectrum) is essential for smooth string skipping, and yet it’s often one of the most overlooked and neglected aspects of one’s technical development and practice routine. So before we jump into string skipping, I’m going to break down what I find to be the most effective approach to picking, so that you can tackle these exercises from the best possible angle.

            <p>
                Sweep picking is a guitar playing technique that involves using a sweeping motion of the pick (or plectrum) across the strings in a specific direction to play a series of consecutive notes on adjacent strings. This technique is known for its fluid and sweeping sound and is often used to play arpeggios, which are chords where the notes are played one at a time in a specific sequence
            </p>
            <h3 class="title">Downstroke Sweeping</h3>
            <p>
                It's usual to start off with downstroke sweeping. Just like it's normal to strum your chords with downstrokes before you tackle upstrokes. The example above is perhaps the simplest of these sweep picking patterns. However, although there are multiple fret 3s in a row, don't be tempted to let it all ring out like a broken barre chord.

        <section id="Hybrid_Picking" class="main-section">
            <header class="title"><h1>Hybrid Picking</h1></header>
            <p>
                Hybrid picking is a guitar playing technique that combines the use of both the pick (plectrum) and the fingers of the picking hand (usually the middle, ring, and pinky fingers) to pluck the strings. It offers greater flexibility and control over the strings, allowing the guitarist to produce a wider range of sounds and execute complex picking patterns.
            </p>
            <h3 class="title">Pick and Second Finger</h3>
            <p>
                This example shows a basic hybrid-picking pattern using notes of the B Minor Pentatonic scale. This example alternates between using a down-pick on the D string and second-finger pick on the G string.
                Make sure that your down-stroke and second finger pick are dynamically even
